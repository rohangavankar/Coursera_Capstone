There are many problems that arise from an accident, especially a severe one, including traffic, use of emergency vehicles, congestion in the area, delays, and more. The data is provided by the Seattle Police Department. We can use this data to learn how to limit accidents and prevent especially severe ones. The data would most benefit a group liket the Seattle Department of Transportation in managing a huge city and trying to prevent severe collisions. It could also warn passengers about the likelihood of an accident based on some of the features in the dataset including weather and road conditions."

Realizing that although speeding and driving had a nice correlation, those are uncontrollable features and would not help the Department of Transportation. However analyzing that light, road, and weather conditions played a role and proving that shows that these are features that passengers could take into account when driving. The model was a good model, with an accuracy of 70% but the biggest factor of this analysis was seeing the correlation between natural conditions and accidents. We can conclude that the way to make passengers get into less accidents is by making them aware of light road and weather conditions.\n"

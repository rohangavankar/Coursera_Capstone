# Introduction/Business Problem
The data that is provided represents a series of accidents in the Seattle area, including many specific features and details of these accidents and a severity code, measuring the extremity of the accident. There are many problems that arise from an accident, especially a severe one, including traffic, use of emergency vehicles, congestion in the area, delays, and more. The data is provided by the Seattle Police Department. We can use this data to learn how to limit accidents and prevent especially severe ones. The data would most benefit a group like the Seattle Department of Transportation in managing a huge city and trying to prevent severe collisions. It could also warn passengers about the likelihood of an accident based on some of the features in the dataset including weather and road conditions.

# Data Understanding and Prep
There were 37 attributes in the dataset provided in this course. However many of these attributes were insignificant to the severity score which is the label in the dataset. At first I used all of the data and replaced NaN values with zeroes for some binary columns like speeding and right of way granted to the pedestrian. For the columns that I felt were insignificant and included many NaN's I dropped them. After encoding the data into numbers and getting rid of NaN values I was able to test the correlation of each of the features with the label severitycode. I found that many features, especially ones that I felt would not work, did not have high correlation scores. I went back into the code and selected features that I felt would impact the severeity of an accident. Repeating the process again, I came across low correlations all throughout, but the P-values were low and thus good for some attributes. These included road condition, weather, light condition, speeding, under the influence, and the code of the type of accident. Even though they all had really good P-values, I felt that speeding and dui's were unrecognizable and that obviously had good P-values with severity. Because these are unavoidable from the passengers viewpoint, I felt that I should remove the instances of speeding and driving under the influence from the dataset, and then drop those columns. If the model was to include these atrrbiutes then essentially one is saying that you can predict when a person speeds or is drunk, which is not possible. At the end I was left with four attributes, mostly predictable and natural. This would help the DOT of Seattle to warn drivers and are good attributes to build a model off of.
